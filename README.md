cattbl
===========

Python modules for working in pandas with various loss data tables used for CAT modelling


## Installation

I use a virtual environment. You can see requirements in the file `requirements.txt`

For linux you need odbc headers which can be found in `unixodbc-dev`

You can install locally with

```
python setup.py install
```

## Modules
Best in python if you do
```
import cattbl
help(cattbl)
```
Then help on each module.

...documentation will be incomplete but more up-to-date than here.
